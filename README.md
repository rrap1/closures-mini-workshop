# Closures Mini-Workshop (Student Repo)

**Duration:** 90 minutes (in-workshop exercises)  
**Focus:** Using closures to persist state across calls, guided by APS (Approach to Problem Solving).

## Problems
You will work through three problems in `problems/`:
1. `addByX.js` (APS review)
2. `callTimes.js` (pairs)
3. `saveOutput.js` (trios)

Each file contains:
- A student-facing prompt at the top
- A starter function
- An optional `runTests()` function that you can uncomment locally

> Tip: Use the APS steps as you work (Define success → Explore key phrases → Match actions → Redefine if needed → Create strategy).

## Getting Started
1. **Codespaces** or local: open the repo in VS Code.
2. Open a problem file in `problems/`.
3. Fill in the function body.
4. Uncomment the `runTests()` call at the bottom to try your solution.

## Stretch Ideas
- Combine adders from `addByX`: Write a function that takes two `addByX` functions (like `addByTwo` and `addByThree`) and returns a new function that adds both amounts.
- Make `callTimes` resettable: Add functionality to reset the counter back to zero.
- Extend `saveOutput`: Support functions that take multiple arguments.

**Workshop Expectation:** For each problem, run the minimal examples provided, then **add ONE of your own** test call(s) to validate your solution (edge case or independent instance). Keep it short — you have ~20 minutes per challenge.
